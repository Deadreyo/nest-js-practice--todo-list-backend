# Todo backend with NestJS Project

## Description

A simple project to learn NestJS, a NodeJS framework for building backend applications. This project follows this [guide post](https://masteringbackend.com/posts/nestjs-typescrpt-ultimate-guide). This was not a blind copy-paste project, I tried to understand the concepts and implement the code manually by hand.
