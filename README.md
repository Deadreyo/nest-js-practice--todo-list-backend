# Todo backend with NestJS Project

A simple project to learn NestJS, a NodeJS framework for building backend applications. This project follows this [guide post](https://masteringbackend.com/posts/nestjs-typescrpt-ultimate-guide). This was not a blind copy-paste project, I tried to understand the concepts and implement the code manually by hand.

The guide post was a very quick hands-on introduction to NestJS. Good for a quick starting point, but very shallow.

## Description

A simple todo backend application with NestJS. It uses a simple in-memory database to store the todo items. The application uses CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete todo items.
